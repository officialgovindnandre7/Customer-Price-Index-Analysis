## Problem Statement  
The objective of this analysis is to understand the patterns and trends in **Consumer Price Index (CPI)** over time, particularly examining how inflation impacts specific sectors and product categories.  

### **Key Questions to Answer:**  
1. How has the CPI changed over time in **Rural, Urban, and Combined (Rural+Urban)** sectors?  
2. Which product categories exhibit the highest **inflationary pressures**, and how have these trends varied by sector?  
3. How does the **general CPI index correlate** with specific categories such as **Fuel & Light or Food & Beverages**?

Conclusion
The key findings from the CPI analysis are as follows:

1. Overall Inflation Trend: There has been a steady increase in the CPI over the past decade, with inflation particularly rising after       2020.
2. Minimal Seasonal Effect: The seasonal decomposition shows minimal seasonal fluctuations, indicating that CPI trends are mainly driven by long-term factors.
3. Rural vs. Urban Impact: Inflation levels are consistent across rural, urban, and combined sectors, suggesting uniform price changes in these regions.
4. Sectoral Correlations: High correlations are observed between sectors like housing, transport, and miscellaneous, indicating their significant impact on overall inflation, while categories like eggs and vegetables show more independent price movements.
5. Sector-Specific Trends: Fuel and light have experienced the steepest price increase, especially post-2020, while health and housing show steady inflation growth. Cereals and products display more volatility.
6. COVID-19 Impact (2020-2021): During the pandemic, fuel prices initially dropped due to lower demand, then surged in 2021. Health and housing sectors saw consistent price increases, reflecting inflationary pressures on essential services during this period.
