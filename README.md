# Consumer Price Index (CPI) Analysis 📊  

## Problem Statement  
The objective of this analysis is to understand the patterns and trends in **Consumer Price Index (CPI)** over time, particularly examining how inflation impacts specific sectors and product categories.  

### **Key Questions to Answer:**  
1. How has the CPI changed over time in **Rural, Urban, and Combined (Rural+Urban)** sectors?  
2. Which product categories exhibit the highest **inflationary pressures**, and how have these trends varied by sector?  
3. How does the **general CPI index correlate** with specific categories such as **Fuel & Light or Food & Beverages**?

## 📂 Dataset Overview  
The dataset contains **monthly CPI data** categorized by different sectors and product categories. The data includes:  
- **Date** (Year, Month)  
- **CPI values for different product categories**  
- **Sector-wise breakdown** (Rural, Urban, Combined)
